        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
          We believe every person deserves to feel safe when interacting online. SocialGuard uses advanced heuristics and social signals to help users evaluate whether a profile is legitimate, suspicious or clearly fake. We prioritize transparency and simplicity, making it easy for anyone to use our detection tool-no technical background needed.

        <h2>Why We Built It</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
          With the explosion of social media, it's become easier than ever for malicious actors to create fake profiles that imitate real individuals or brands. This can lead to scams, misinformation, and emotional harm. SocialGuard was created with the goal of using technology for good to make digital spaces a little safer for everyone.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
